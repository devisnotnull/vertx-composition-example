# Where to find the expected sources / Information

 * Had been edited in NetBeans, so if you expect to find eclipse project files, you should run ``mvn eclipse:eclipse` or `./gradlew eclipse` first
 * The handlers itself are `com.mycompany.myproject.CompositionHandler` and ``com.mycompany.myproject.RxCompositionHandler`
 * Helper-Classes are `com.mycompany.myproject.util.event.ChainableProcess`
 * Tests are `com.mycompany.myproject.test.integration.java.CompositionHandlerIntegrationTest`, `com.mycompany.myproject.test.integration.java.RxCompositionHandlerIntegrationTest`, `com.mycompany.myproject.test.integration.java.RxCompositionHandlerTest`, `com.mycompany.myproject.util.event.ChainableProcessTest`
